I'm using Selenium Webdriver and unittest to automate the login functionality of the Texidium Brand.
The automoation process opens 3 browser tabs, and try to login with invalid credentials.
The test case verifies that an error message is displayed.

To see the script, choose kivuto_solutions_login.py and click on it.
